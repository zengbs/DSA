John Ryan "J.R." Fitzpatrick (born May 9, 1988 in Cambridge, Ontario) is a Canadian stock car driver. He is currently the youngest driver to win the CASCAR Super Series championship. He drives the No. 84 Chevrolet for Fitzpatrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and the No. 60 Chevrolet for Turn One Racing in the Camping World Truck Series. John Ryan (J.R.) Fitzpatrick got his first taste of racing in karts at the age of six, moving quickly to the Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (CASCAR) junior ranks and then on to Late Model stock cars by the time he was 13 years old. Racing in the Cascar Super Series what is now the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series at age 16, Fitzpatrick finished 11th in the point standings and second in the Rookie of the Year standings in 2004. Then at 17, he achieved three top-five and five top-10 finishes, scoring his first win. At age 18, he became the youngest driver to become a Canadian Tire Series National Champion with one win, five podium finishes and two pole awards. He remained in his fathers #84 Chevrolet after CASCAR was acquired by NASCAR; In 2007, Fitzpatrick earned two wins, four top-fives, seven top-10s and three pole awards in the Canadian Tire Series where sponsorship came from Milwaukee Tools. In 2008 he had one victory (Mosport), five top-fives, six top-10s and two pole awards. While 2009, he drove the #84 for a part time deal winning Circuit Gilles Villeneuve leading the most laps. For 2010 he returned to the series full time with sponsorship from Shick he picked up his first win of the season at Mosport on the road course layout on June 13 and also won the event at Edmonton, he swapped the points lead with D.J. Kennington for over five times during the year going on to finishes second in the points. He ran again in the series in 2011, finishing third in points; he will return to the series in the No. 84 in 2012.[1] In early 2012 it was announced that Fitzpatrick would compete in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race in August 2012 at Watkins Glen International for Turn One Racing.[1] Fitzpatrick made his mainstream NASCAR debut in the NASCAR Busch Series (now the NASCAR Nationwide Series) race at the Telcel-Motorola Mexico 200 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City, Mexico. He came in 33rd place in that race[2] due to an ill handling racecar. He finished 43rd in the NASCAR Busch Series race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec on August 4, 2007,[3] right after the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series race at the same track where he won the race. He drove the famed #4 KHI Chevy at both of the road courses in 2009. He Finishing 19th at Watkins Glen after getting in a wreck on the last lap. In Montreal he was on pace for a top 10 finish before staling the car after going off course leading to a poor finish one lap down. It was announced that J.R. will drive for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in all three road course in his #7 team for 2010, he picked up his first Nationwide top 10 coming home 7th at Road America (Nationwide)on June 19 and his second top 10 with a 7th in Montreal.

In game design, balance is the concept and the practice of tuning a game's rules, usually with the goal of preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers. An unbalanced system represents wasted development resources at the very least, and at worst can undermine the game's entire ruleset by making important roles or tasks impossible to perform.[1] Balancing does not necessarily mean making a game fair. This is particularly true of action games: Jaime Griesemer, design lead at Bungie, said in a lecture to other designers that "every fight in Halo is unfair".[2] This potential for unfairness creates uncertainty, leading to the tension and excitement that action games seek to deliver.[3][4][1] In these cases balancing is instead the management of unfair scenarios, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all of the strategies which the game intends to support are viable.[2] The extent to which those strategies are equal to one another defines the character of the game in question. Simulation games can be balanced unfairly in order to be true to life. A wargame may cast the player into the role of a general who was defeated by an overwhelming force, and it is common for the abilities of teams in sports games to mirror those of the real-world teams they represent regardless of the implications for players who pick them. Digital games often allow players to influence their balance by offering a choice of "difficulty levels".[5] These affect how challenging the game is to play. In addition to altering the game's rules, difficulty levels can be used to alter what content is presented to the player. This usually takes the form of adding or removing challenging location or events, but some games also change their narrative to reward players who play them on higher difficulty levels (Max Payne 2) or end early as punishment for playing on easy (Castlevania). Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly, particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally and the standard "easy/hard" terminology no longer applies. Sometimes veiled language is used (Mario Kart offers "CC select"), while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option. An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time, a technique that has been called "subjective difficulty".[6] This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes, each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels (Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Generations). Difficulty can also be managed by a third party or the game itself; see the Gamemaster section below. Balancing goals shift dramatically when players are contending with the game's environment and/or non-player characters. Such player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players' abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles.[4] This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure,[3] generally referred to by game designers as "pacing". Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games, but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control. The simplest game balancing technique is giving each player identical resources. Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry; some (such as Pong) are completely symmetric, but those in which players alternate turns (such as Chess) can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first-move advantage. Symmetry can be undone by human psychology. The advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well-documented example of this.[7][8] The brute force approach to balancing is the mathematical analysis of game session results. With enough data, it is possible to identify unbalanced areas of a game and make corrections. Randomisation of starting conditions is a technique common in board games, card games, and also experimental research[9] which fights back against the human tendency to optimise patterns in one's favour.[2] The downside of randomisation is that it takes control away from the player, potentially leading to frustration. Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimise (Scrabble, Magic: The Gathering) and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session (Klondike (solitaire), Strange Adventures in Infinite Space). Many games become more challenging if the player is successful. For instance, real-time strategy games often feature "upkeep", a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player's control.[10] Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents' territory (football, capture the flag) have a feedback loop by default: the further a player pushes, the more opponents they are likely to face. Feedback loops can lead to frequent ties if enforced too strictly. See also Dynamic game difficulty balancing. A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their emotional state (Dungeons & Dragons, Left 4 Dead). Although gamemasters have historically been humans, some videogames now feature AI systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input.[4] Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems.[11] In role-playing game slang, a "gimp" is a character, character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game. Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience.[12] A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class, or by developing the character inefficiently.[13] However, this is not always the case, as some characters are purposely "gimped" by the game's developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level, or, conversely, to give the player an early head-start. An example of this is Final Fantasy's Mystic Knight class, which starts out weak, but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level. Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer, and may require a software patch to rebalance. Sometimes, especially in MMORPGs, gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target. Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf[citation needed], gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target.[14] A "nerf" is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change.[15] The first established use of the term was in Ultima Online, as a reference to the NERF brand of toys which are soft and less likely to cause serious injury.[16][17] Among game developers, MMORPG designers are especially likely to nerf aspects of a game in order to maintain game balance. Occasionally a new feature (such as an item, class, or skill) may be made too powerful, too cheap, or too easily obtained to the extent that it unbalances the game system. This is sometimes due to an unforeseen bug or method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers.[16][18] The frequency of nerfing and the scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game but almost all massively multiplayer games have engaged in nerfing at some point.[18] Nerfs in various online games, including Anarchy Online, have spurred in-world protests.[17] Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players, a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy. As players respond, the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium. This impact on the economy, along with the original impact of the nerf, can cause large player resentment for even a small change.[17][18] In particular, in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed, players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features.[17][18] A well-known instance in which a nerf has caused many protests, but much more praise, is when Infinity Ward nerfed the Model 1887s in its video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Before the nerf, the Model 1887s were able to One Shot Kill from medium-long range when all other shotguns in game were limited to short-medium range. The nerfing of the Model 1887s reduced its range to short range. For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value, this may bring up legal issues over the lost value.[19] Overpowered (often abbreviated to OP) is a common term referring to a perceived lack of game balance. It is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games. For something to be deemed overpowered, it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations (marginalising other choices) and/or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it.

The Pentagon () home computer was a clone of the British-made Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128. It was manufactured by amateurs in the former Soviet Union. Its PCB was copied all over the USSR, which made it the most widespread Soviet ZX Spectrum clone[citation needed]. Many simple devices (upgrades) were invented to connect to the Pentagon with a soldering iron. The last Pentagon model was the Pentagon 1024SL v2.3, which included most of the upgrades of the standard Spectrum architecture, including 1024KB RAM, Beta 128 Disk Interface and ZX-BUS slots (especially for IDE and General Sound cards). This model also featured a "turbo" mode (7 MHz instead of the original's 3.50MHz).  I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org

Konrad Bleuler (23 September 1912, Herzogenbuchsee  1 January 1992, Knigswinter) was a Swiss physicist who worked in the field of theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory.[1] He is known for his work on the quantisation of the photon, the GuptaBleuler formalism.[2] Bleuler was born in Herzogenbuchsee, Switzerland on 23 September 1912. He received his doctorate for the mathematical work titled "On the Rolle's theorem for the operator u + u and related properties of the Green's function" from the ETH Zurich in 1942. His thesis advisor was Michel Plancherel. From 1960 to 1980 he was a Professor at the University of Bonn, where he founded the Institute of Theoretical Nuclear Physics, which is now the Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics. Even after his retirement, he was active and remained there until his death. 1971 Bleuler organized the first "International Conference on Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics" and since then he had been organizing the conference regularly. The last one was the 19th Conference in 1990 held at Rapallo. In 1993, at the 22nd Conference in his honor a "Bleuler Medal" awarded.[2] Bleuler's most notable contribution was the introduction of GuptaBleuler formalism for the quantization of the electromagnetic field, which he developed independently with Suraj N. Gupta.[3] This was an important work on quantum electrodynamics. Bleuler also made contributions to nuclear and particle physics. He also wrote about the work of other famous scientists, so on Wolfgang Pauli[4] and Rolf Nevanlinna. I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org

Festus Walters (18491922) was an Ohio jurist and advocate for Gubernatorial judicial independence known for the controversial decision to try an Ohio National Guard commander for murder following the Washington County Courthouse riots of 1895. Among the Ohio Five arriving at Cornell University when that revolutionary institution opened its doors, he was life-long friends with fellow Cornellian and fraternity brother, Senator Joseph B. Foraker. In 1898, the official history of the Republican Party in Ohio stated that [t]he Republican party may well be judged by its degree of intelligence, its usefulness and safety in the management of public affairs, and its achievements during the forty years of its existence. It is a party of principle, and though its opponents may criticise its doctrines they cannot deny that it has always had the courage of its convictions. As long as it continues it will attract to its ranks men of brilliant minds and intellectual giants who give freely of their great gifts to aid the maintenance of a party that has done so much for the prosperity of the country. Ohio has in the past contributed her share of famous men, and as the years roll on the names of others are added one by one to the rapidly increasing list. One that has become prominently associated with the political history of the state is that of Judge Festus Walters . . . personally the Judge is courteous and affable, and is an excellent entertainer, though not a society man in the strict sense of the word.[1] Festus Walters descended in the maternal line from the Peters family of Fairfield, County, Ohio. It is unknown when the eponymous Peters ancestor landed in America, or from what country. Like many whose descendants settled southern Ohio, he settled in Philadelphia, married, and sired two sons born in Philadelphia, Jacob and Henry. Henry died without issue. Jacob married. He moved south to Baltimore, raising three sons and one daughter. The daughter married a man named Burns. The sons were John, Jacob and Samuel. Samuel, son of Jacob and the ancestor of Ohios Judge Festus Walters, was born in Philadelphia on September 27, 1772. He died at his home in Amanda township, Fairfield County, Ohio, September 10, 1829. His wife was Mary Stevenson, daughter of Daniel Stevenson, of Baltimore County, Maryland. She was born September 28, 1773, and died in Fairfield County, February 15, 1861, aged 87 years. Their oldest son, Henry Peters, was born October 1, 1796. They trekked to the Ohio valley in April, 1812, and lived for five years on what became the Frank Stevenson farm. Daniel Stevenson was born September 21, 1737 and died September 3, 1829. Ruth, his wife, was born January 24, 1743, and died January 12, 1834. They were the parents of ten children. They came to Ohio several years before Peters and his wife. The wife of Samuel Peters was a model woman and mother. She was a daughter of Daniel Stevenson, one of the early pioneers of Richland township, and on whose land the first Methodist church in the county was erected. The old homestead remained in the Stevenson family for many years. A grandson of Daniel was the landsman when Festus Walters was sitting on the Ohio bench. There were several brothers and sisters of the Stevenson family, Daniel, Jesse, Mordecai, Edward, Mrs. Peters  who was Judge Walters grandmother  and Mrs. Hampson were those most remembered; most of them were born in Maryland and came to Ohio with their father as early as 1803. Daniel Stevenson, the pioneer and father of this large family, was a very prominent man of the Republics early days and much respected for his sterling character. He was a Methodist and donated land for the first church in the county. He entertained the evangelist Bishop Asbury during his visits to Fairfield County, and it was on his land where Asbury conducted the first camp meeting held in the county. The early church was constructed of hewn logs, carved with big broad axes, and with a skill available to a select few of the pioneer workman, and with what skill the corner men could notch the logs perfectly, and carry up their corner, a perilous job, but performed by hundreds of men. With respect to the Peters family, Mr. Peters and wife arrived in the Ohio valley in 1812. They settled two miles north of West Rushville, on Rush Creek, at the mouth of Snake run. The Peters remained on Rush Creek for about five years. They purchased land south of Royalton later owned by Benjamin Haas, cut a farm and endured the hardships incidental to pioneer life. Here they spent their lives, living the quiet life of farmers and rearing a large family of children. Mr. Peters was a man of sterling character and possessed good business sense. Peters was prominent and beloved in his neighborhood, and exerted an influence in the community far above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals. I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
